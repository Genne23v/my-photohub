There's never been a time where people had to cope with more images. At the same time, most companies take advantage of our desire to share what we create, charging for storage.

My Photohub is designed to leverage the open web and make it easy for anyone to take a bunch of photos and turn them into a web page they can share with the world. You don't need to be a programmer to take advantage of the web or GitHub in order to share your photos.
